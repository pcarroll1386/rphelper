helper for rp
This is a tool for people who do not know how to play table top rpgs. I am starting with Dungens and Dragons 5E. This tool will let someone who does not know how to build a character or know the rules of play, be able to quickley create a character. and participate in combat an other activities without having to know any of the rules.

Secondly it will be a tool for a game master to tie in to each character in thier campaine and use this app to track turns, monster health and other effects reducing the time it takes to repeat themselves. So the Role playing can take center stage and not be interupted by long explinations of rules each round to new players. 

Unfinished
Working on Mock ups and then will decide what technologies to use for this project
